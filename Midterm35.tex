A bullet of mass $m$ is moving horizontally with speed $v_o$ when it hits a block of mass 100m that is at rest on a horizontal frictionless table. The surface of the table is a height $h$ above the floor. After the impact, the bullet and the block slide off the table and hit the floor a distance $x$ from the edge of the table. \\
